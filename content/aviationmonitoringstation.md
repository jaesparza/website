## Thermal considerations

The RTL-SDR dongles are known to reach high temperatures, up to 80 deg. C in some components. In the early versions of the dongles this issue was particularly bad. [S50LEA](http://lea.hamradio.si/~s57uuu/mischam/rtlsdr/thermal.htm) documented this issue and took thermal images of the system before and after adding a heathsink.

-->

In this project, I was planning to set all the electronic hardware (voltage regulator, embedded linux board and at least one RTL-dongle) in a waterproof PCV box. Even though the dongle that I am using is a bit more modern than the one shown in the thermal image, thermal issues are still relevant. To assess how hot the whole setup gets while powered I have run a number of experiments. 

The following temperature sensors have been placed in the hardware:
* one BME-280 sensor in direct contact through a thermal sticker to the RTL-SDR dongle metal case.
* one BME-280 sensor measuring temperature inside the waterproof box.
* one sensor in the die.

All the measurements have been taken with the box exposed to an ambient temperature of 25.5 deg. C

I have developed a [python script]() to read periodically the temperature sensor and print the readings to stdout. [Armbianmonitor]() is used to monitor the cpu state. The measurement scripts are launched in three separate terminals as follows:
```
ja@orangepi-r1:~/$ python3 myTPreader.py -c 0 -d 1 | tee lidClosedIdle_inside

ja@orangepi-r1:~/$ python3 myTPreader.py -c 1 -d 1 | tee lidClosedIdle_sdr

ja@orangepi-r1:~/$ armbian -m | tee lidClosedIdle_die_Opi
```
### Measurements

Temperature measurements are collected when the system is in these two different states:

Idle state:
* 1 x RTL sdr connected
* system booted and idle
* average current draw of 200 mA @ 12V (2.4 Watts)

RX state - system receiving in the VHF airband:
* 1 x RTL sdr connected
* system in RX
* rtl_tcp running
* average current draw of XXX mA
