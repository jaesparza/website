The stepper motor is driven from a controller that can be configured to drive regular broadcasting capacitors, butterfly capacitors or vacuum capacitors. The main differences when it comes to reaching minimum to maximum capacitance is:
* Broadcasting capacitor: minimum to maximum capacitnace is achieved between 0 to 180 degrees and rotation is mechanically constrained.
* Butterfly capacitor: minimum to maximum capacitance is achieved between 0 to 90 degress and rotation is not mechanically constrained.
* Vacuum capacitor: minimum to maximum capacitance is achieved through a number of rotations and is mechanically constrained.

In this case, the selected vacuum capacitor requires **X rotations**
