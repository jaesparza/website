# Magnetic loop antennas for HF bands

* Description of the content
* Antenna dimensions
* Control units
* Limitations
* Advantages
* Applicability (7 - 28 MHz)

Consider how to structure the content here, might be a good idea to split the page in several ones:
* "Landing" page, containing a general description of the projects, the motivation and an explanation on how the contents are structured.
* A single page con theoretical considerations with all the formulae - reference to the github page.

Notes no tuning units
* Manual tuning - tests with broadcasting capacitors
* Driving stepper motors and reducing vibrations
* L2: Butterfly variable capacitor tuning unit
* L2: Vacuum capacitor tuning unit
* AB encoders, gray encoders and multiturn potentiomters


Notes on controllers
* Wired stepper controller
* Wireless stepper controller
* L2: Wireless communications
* L2: PC software

Notes on antenna dimensions and constructions:
* Coax loop
* Bike rim loop
* Heliax/Cellflex cable loop
* Plumber's copper tube

Tests <br />
* Deployment
* Videos of operation

How to structure the rest of the content? Tests, disclamers, etc...

## Disclamer

The antennas described here can generate high intensity RF fields in their vecinity as well as develop high voltages. If you decide to build them, do it at your own risk.

## Motivation

## Theoretical considerations

### Antenna dimension cancluations

### Reduction and tunning resolution

## Mechanical construction
* Stepper motors NEMA17
* Stepper motor with reduction

### Air variable capacitor unit

### Vacuum variable capacitor unit

## Software design

### Wired control unit
* Controlling the stepper motors, real-time considerations

### Wireless control unit
#### Embedded software
#### PC software

## Hardware design

### Wired control unit

### Wireless control unit

## Tests
* Antenna mounts
* Adding common mode chockes

## Concluding remarks

### Further work
* NEC modelling
* Implement it with either a faster processor or with two arduino controllers.

### Commercial models
* MFJ
* INAC
* Ciro Mazzoni
* Alexloop
* Chameleon
* MLA-M/T
* KÃ¤ferlein loop
### Will I build it again?
